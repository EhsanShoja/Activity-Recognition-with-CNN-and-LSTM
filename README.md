# Activity-Recognition-with-CNN-and-LSTM
In this project, I am using UCF101 - Action Recognition DataSet. The goal is to solve the problem using Convolution neural networks(CNN) to extract visual features from images and applying Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) networks to consider temporal information.
